Collabo is an application which allows students to collaborate across classrooms and the 
entire USA.

The system was developed by:
Aliza Miller
Abdulwahab Alothaim
Khashkhuu Otgontulga
Manish Suthar

The current work is a prototype in its first iteration.

The app screens switch between content coded in html, css, and javascript, and MARVEL App animated prototyped pages.

In order to properly view the app, please go to https://aymi11er.github.io/Collabo/ on a cell phone or in Chrome with the screen set to the size of a cell phone, this can be done by re-sizing the screen or pressing cntl+optn+j.
